# Done

- parse file 
- api to insert data into DB
- password modal created

# Next Today

- after setting password -> toggle flag -> use that password in encryption utils
- set up e2e
- changed UI for signed in with a message if no book or file ever uploaded
- implement UI for reflection with apis + encryption

# Breaking Down Tasks:

- implementing e2e encryption:
    on sign in:
    - inform the user that their data is encrypted end-to-end and they need to set an encryption password to access their data
    - implement a secure prompt for them to set their password on first use
    on password set:
    - use the password to derive a cryptographic key (using a secure hash function and salt)
    - use this key to encrypt and decrypt their data in the browser
    when populating UI:
    - prompt the user for their password after login, before displaying any data
    - use the entered password to derive the key and decrypt their data client-side
    - show a loading spinner or password prompt until decryption is successful
    * note: the server cannot filter or search encrypted data; all searching/filtering must be done client-side after decryption
    * users must enter their password on every device and after logging out

- UI creation:
    - if first sign in prompt user with a modal to create a password
    - use that password in the encyption util
