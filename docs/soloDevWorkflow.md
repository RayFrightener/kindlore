### **Recommended Solo Dev Workflow**

1. **Daily/Weekly Planning**
   - At the start of your day (or week), write down:
     - What you’ve finished
     - What’s next (broad goals + specific tasks)
   - Use a simple text file, markdown doc, or a tool like Notion, Trello, or GitHub Projects.

2. **Task Breakdown**
   - Break big features into small, actionable tasks.
   - Example:  
     - “Implement upload API”  
     - “Validate file on frontend”  
     - “Deduplicate clippings in DB”

3. **Prioritize**
   - Decide what’s most important or blocking other work.
   - Focus on one main task at a time.

4. **Document Decisions**
   - When you make a design or architecture choice, jot down a quick note about why.
   - This helps future-you (and anyone who joins later).

5. **End-of-Day Review**
   - Write what you finished, what’s left, and any blockers.
   - Move unfinished tasks to tomorrow’s list.

6. **Version Control**
   - Commit code often with clear messages.
   - Use branches for features/bugs if possible.

7. **Keep a “Backlog”**
   - If you think of a new idea or bug, add it to a backlog list so you don’t lose focus.
