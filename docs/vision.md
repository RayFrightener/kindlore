# Vision

## What is it?
A tool that lets users upload a file, processes it, populates a custom UI with entries, and lets them reflect or journal on those entries.

## Who is it for?
People who want to extract meaning from data files — e.g., logs, notes, journals — and interact with them meaningfully.

## Key Goals
- Upload → Process → Reflect
- Save individual reflections
- Export or delete data
